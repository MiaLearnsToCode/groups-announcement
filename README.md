# Groups announcement

This is a small project I built to announce members of group projects for SEI Project 3. 

Demo: http://miameroi.com/groups-announcement/

If you want to use this project to announce the groups in the class, clone the repo and add your chosen members to each group in the groups.js file. 

A sample would look something like this: 

```
const groups = {
  one: ['Jane', 'Sophie', 'Mark'],
  two: ['John', 'Jack', 'Mia', 'Clare']
}
```

Once you are done updating the data, simply open the index.js file in the browser and click on each chip one at a time to reveal the team members!
